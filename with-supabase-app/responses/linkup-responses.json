        "snippet": "&quot;Low Budget&quot; is the sixth track from The Kinks&#x27; album of the same name. It was written, produced and sung by Ray Davies. &quot;Low Budget&quot; was recorded in January 1979. It describes a man giving up his &quot;expensive tastes&quot; in order to save money. Like many of the tracks on Low Budget, it applies to ...\nAlthough \"Low Budget\" refers to economic problems of the times in general, it also refers to some of Ray Davies' own personal concerns. In the song, Davies mocks his own fear of not having money and his frugality. The song also references Davies' vanity. The singer describes himself as once being well dressed and able to afford cigars, but now has to buy discount clothes and chew mints.\nI like “Low Budget” [1979]. It’s wild. I like that kind of, almost country-style playing. It’s like a shape; I don’t even worry about what notes I play as I’m doing it. And if you catch a few open strings, you might get lucky with a weird clunk or a harmonic or something.\nOf a performance in Binghamton, New York on February 18, 1979, the Binghamton University newspaper Pipe Dream noted that \"'Low Budget' became an audience effort when Davies ceded his microphone to members of the front row during the chorus.\" In 1980, a live version of \"Low Budget\" (recorded at Providence Civic Center, Providence, Rhode Island, on 23 September 1979) was released on the album One for the Road.\nHe describes himself as \"a cut-price person in a low-budget land.\" But despite being reduced to poverty, the singer expresses pride in his hair and his teeth.\nAuthor Thomas Kitts notes that even the title, used in the refrain \"I'm on a low budget\" could refer to Davies keeping himself on a tight budget.",

According to Rotten Tomatoes, the critics gave the film a rating of 50% on the website, which is considered just an average flick. And on the contrary, despite having a much lower budget, Primitive War has impressed critics more than these four movies from the Jurassic Park/World franchise.\nDirected and produced by Luke Sparke, Primitive War found worldwide fame for being a fresh take on the genre, as well as the astonishingly low budget with which it was made.\nDespite a massive budget, Jurassic World Dominion wasn’t able to please critics, and Dominion is considered one of the lowest-rated movies in the franchise.",

It was their first to feature bassist Jim Rodford who would remain with the group until their disbandment in 1996. Following the minor success of their 1978 album Misfits, the band recorded the majority of the album in New York rather than London.\nDespite being a relative failure in the UK, Low Budget was a critical and commercial success in the United States, becoming the Kinks' best-selling studio album and peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart.\nAvory eventually agreed to stay, while ex-Argent bass player Jim Rodford, and keyboardist Gordon John Edwards were recruited, the latter having played with the Pretty Things on their album Silk Torpedo. Edwards was shortly afterwards fired from the group for failing to show up to sessions for Low Budget (although he recorded piano on at least one of the album's tracks), being replaced with Ian Gibbons following the album's release.\nRecording for Low Budget began in early 1979 at the band's own Konk Studios in London, where \"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\", the result of Arista founder Clive Davis's request for a radio-friendly hit, and the album's title track were cut. After these sessions, the rest of the album was recorded at the Power Station and Blue Rock Studios in New York City.\nAlong with the tracks that appeared in the final running order of Low Budget, versions of songs that would appear on the album's 1981 follow-up Give the People What They Want, such as \"Destroyer\" and \"Give the People What They Want\" (and possibly \"Yo-Yo\" and \"Better Things\") were attempted.",

Learn how to budget your money with a low income.\nWhether you’re stuck in a low-paying job or you’re battling inflation, I know it can be hard to make progress toward your goals—let alone make ends meet—on a lower income. Forget thriving. Maybe you’re just trying to survive. But no matter how much you make, there are things you can do to feel more in control of your finances. I’m going to walk you through how to budget your money with a low income.\nEven if you have a low income, you still can (and should) make a plan for your money. It’s all about working with what you have. And a budget helps you do just that by telling your money where to go each month.\nAnd if you work on commission or have an irregular income, just use your lowest monthly income as a place to start (you can always go up from there). Once you’ve got your total monthly income figured out, your next step is to plan for all your monthly expenses. (This is when you’ll use your bank account to get a better idea of your spending.) Before you can budget for the things you want, you’ve got to make sure the basics are taken care of.\nIf you have your emergency fund and you’re making the right decisions with your current income, you won’t have to rely on debt to bail you out. And if you’ve already got debt, paying it off will help you free up your budget that much more! Low income or not, you can still have control over your money by making and sticking to a budget.",
